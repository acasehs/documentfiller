- Your response will be inserted under the existing section heading
- Focus only on content that belongs under this specific section

PERSPECTIVE:
- Our companies name is CACI
- When considering our organization and subcontractors you can use Team CACI
- GCSS-MC is acceptable from a program perspective
- GCSS-MC Cyber team is proper for system level cybersecurity related actions

The content must adhere to these requirements to meet professional documentation standards for government systems.
